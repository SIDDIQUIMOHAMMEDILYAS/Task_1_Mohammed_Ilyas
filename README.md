## ✨ Key Features

*   **Semantic HTML5:** Built with proper logic (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) to ensure screen reader accessibility and SEO friendliness.
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** Uses `backdrop-filter: blur()` and `rgba` transparency to create a modern, frosted-glass aesthetic.
*   **Animated Background:** Moving gradient "orbs" provide depth and showcase the transparency effects.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Includes a custom CSS/JS hamburger menu for mobile devices and adaptive grid layouts.
*   **Smooth Interactions:** Hover effects on cards, buttons, and navigation links using CSS transitions.
*   **Single File:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic are contained within a single `index.html` file for easy deployment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** Semantic Markup.
*   **CSS3:** 
    *   CSS Variables (Custom Properties).
    *   Flexbox & CSS Grid.
    *   Keyframe Animations.
